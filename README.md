# Rendering
Final assignment for a Computer Graphics course. This project covers displaying 3d graphics of some basic geometrical shapes. 
It's written in C#, without using any graphics libraries. The produced bitmap is displayed inside a simple WPF app. 

It's possible to choose between different cameras, light sources and shading modes.
